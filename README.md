# nome-mtg-decks
A collection of hopefully enhanced Magic the Gathering preconstructed decks. Relevant branches are so far base - the base decks purchased from Wizards of the Coast, master is my current state in terms of what cards I have managed to add. Future branches will include speculative builds and takes on the deck that then may be added to master on the basis of personal affordability.
